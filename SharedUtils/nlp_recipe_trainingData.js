For something that looks and tastes as impressive as this beef rouladen, it's actually one of the simplest stuffed meat recipes I know. You can pretty much use any cheap cut of beef; I used round steak, but rump, chuck, flap meat, and other similar cuts will work work.

Directions
Step 1

Place slices of beef on a work surface, Season both sides with kosher salt and pepper. Spread one side with mustard. Place bacon strips on the mustard and sprinkle with paprika. Arrange onion slices cross-wise on the beef. Then evenly space 3 pickle slices across each slice of beef. Keep about an inch of the narrowest end of the beef slice free of toppings to facilitate rolling it up.

Step 2

Roll each slice of meat, beginning from the wider of the two short ends, working to keep all ingredients inside the roll. Rolls should be nice and tight. Secure the rolls (seam side down) with 3 loops of butcher's twine, one in the middle and one at each end. Trim excess string.

Step 3

Heat vegetable oil over medium-high heat in a large saucepan. Cook beef, turning and browning well on all sides, about 8 minutes. Remove meat from pan. Reduce heat to medium-low. Melt butter in the pan; whisk in the flour, cooking for about 1 minute. Pour in cold beef broth and whisk vigorously to combine. Raise heat to medium-high and simmer until sauce begins to thicken, about 1 minute.

Step 4

Transfer beef rolls to pan along with accumulated juices. Reduce heat to very low. Simmer gently, covered, turning rolls every 20 minutes or so, until beef is tender, about 1 1/2 hours. When the tip of a sharp knife can easily be inserted into the beef roll, the meat is done.

Step 5

Transfer meat to dish to allow it to rest. Raise heat to high and bring cooking liquid to a simmer to thicken slightly to make a gravy, about 1 minute. Serve rouladen with gravy.

I love to make these! My mother was from Poland and she used sweet pickle instead...both have a great flavor. I also like the way you use the whole piece of meat and roll up. I would cut it up into 3 pieces and makes smaller rollups which is so much work. and I use toothpicks..my mother also made a saltine cracker stuffing (crushed crackers chopped onions 1 egg Kellogg's corn flake crumbs and milk) rollup along with the pickle ones. Thanks for posting and the idea of rolling up in one piece!

Yeeeeesssssss! This is hands down my favorite recipe from Chef John. I was a little nervous about the pickle so I only used half and could have kicked myself for not adding it all. The entire family said it was great.

My parents lived in Germany when I was a kid so I grew up on this. The only differences in how we make it are: 1) After browning the rolls we place in a 350 oven for 1 hour. 2) To make gravy we add baked drippings with mixed flour/water until it thickens stirring constantly. I also don't believe we've ever used paprika. So good! I also frequently make some with chicken for non-beef eaters. It is almost impossible to get it thin enough but the flavor is on point!

Wow what a fantastic recipe! Simple and delicious! I was cooking for a small army (our 6 children plus a friend or 2) so I did modify the cooking method. I followed the recipe exactly right up to the point where you would return the rolls to the pan with the gravy to simmer on the stove until done. Since I was cooking 8 fairly large rolls I put them in a roaster poured the gravy over them (I made enough to cover them almost completely) covered the roster with foil and baked at 350 degrees for 90 minutes. When they were done I skimmed the grease (there was a lot) put the gravy back in the pan I browned them in and thickened it with a little slurry of flour and beef broth. The ONLY thing I might change next time is maybe going with thinner dill spears our cutting it down to 2 per roll. I will without a doubt be making this again!

I have been making this my whole life! I as surprised to see almost the exact re pie as I always use. Having a very large family 6 children and 14 grandchildren I have to make a lot. Therefore I brown them and put them in the oven for an hour and half at 350. I serve with spaetzle and red cabbage. Delist! Right on Chef John.??

Followed the recipe exactly. A bite putzy but absolutely worth it. A good rich beef gravy is a must. Used a choice bottom round steak that I cut down to 1/4 inch thickness then pounded to 1/8-1/16 thickness.

MAPLE FROSTED PUMPKIN SPICE BISCOTTI

The first signs of fall vary from year to year, but no matter how the season begins, I love every second of it! The cooler temperatures, the changing colors of the trees, and most especially the comforting foods!

One of my favorite memories is spending time in the kitchen with my Grandma Marge. She always baked the best treats that made the entire house smell wonderful! I still go back to so many of her family recipes (anything labeled Granny Sarella's in my books!) to recreate as gluten-free and paleo. They're recipes that I want to keep in the family- even if they are a little different than the originals.

Grandma Marge would make a dozen batches of her Christmas biscotti to give as gifts ever since I can remember. The first time that I recreated her biscotti, it was a trial and error process to get that perfect buttery crunch. It took several attempts and she helped me taste test along the way, but I finally perfected it for the recipe that is in Celebrations!

This year, I wanted them earlier than Christmas, so I decided to change a few things to fit the season. If you've followed my blog for any length of time, then you know I love all things pumpkin! I can't help but want that spice mix in everything this time of year!

I decided to use the recipe from Celebrations as a starting point, but I changed some things around to make it into a Maple Frosted Pumpkin Spice Biscotti. The touch of spice comes from nutmeg, clove, ginger, and of course, cinnamon! The frosting is a light glaze that I made by mixing a few ingredients like maple syrup and cacao butter until I got the perfect consistency to stick to the biscotti and harden into a perfectly sweet crunch once it sets. The pumpkin flavor is noticeable, but not overwhelming, and altogether, this may be my new favorite pumpkin recipe!

These taste just as amazing as they sound, I promise! Whether you've made 10 pumpkin recipes already, or if this is your first- it is worthy of your time and resources. Enjoy them in the morning dunked in your coffee, as a midday snack, or an after-dinner treat! Are you obsessed with pumpkin like I am?

Scroll down for the Biscotti recipe!

I wanted to share some of my other favorite pumpkin recipes from the blog for you to try this Fall!

Pumpkin Pancakes with Bacon and Pecans

These Pumpkin Pancakes are quick and easy and delicious during any season! I think they're best on a chilly Autumn morning paired with some coffee. The bacon and pecans add the perfect saltiness and crunch needed to make these extra special!

Pumpkin Spice Lattes

Or page 263, Celebrations

This Pumpkin Spice Latte is a healthier (and better) spin on the PSL you'd find at your favorite coffee shop. This recipe calls for real pumpkin, which gives it the pumpkin flavor, orange color, and the extra body and frothiness to this spiced drink. Be sure to watch the instructional video that goes along with this!

Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Muffins

There’s nothing better than a fluffy pumpkin muffin with gooey chocolate chips and all of the flavors of the fall and winter seasons! This recipe started as a pumpkin bread recipe and was such a favorite here on the blog (see the SCD version here!) that I included it in my Meals Made Simple cookbook (page 64).

Egg-Free & Nut-Free Pumpkin Chocolate Chip Cookies

These cookies have a crisp outside with a chewy center and are full of autumnal spices and melted dark chocolate.

Spiced Pumpkin Granola

This Pumpkin Spice Granola is perfect with milk, on yogurt, or all by itself! It is SO delicious.

It's made from soaked nuts and is flavored with honey and Autumn spices. There's no oats or wheat as typical granola would have. And with this recipe, you won't miss them at all!

Baked Pumpkin Spice Donuts

also on page 256, Against all Grain

These cake donuts are reminiscent of the old-fashioned ones I used to love; dense, satisfying, and rich. They also have 2 different crunchy and sweet glaze options that will fit both the SCD and Paleo restrictions (Dark Chocolate and Maple Vanilla with Bacon Sprinkles). With each bite, you’ll taste all of the flavors of the season: pumpkin, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, cardamom, and clove.

 

Vegan Pumpkin Spice Ice Cream

This is egg and dairy-free, and I promise you won’t miss either of them. It is so creamy and has all of the aromatic spices that you find in a pumpkin pie. In fact, I may change the name to frozen pumpkin pie. Because that’s what your taste buds will think you’re eating.

Maple Frosted Pumpkin Spice Biscotti


AUTHOR: Danielle Walker - AgainstAllGrain.com
INGREDIENTS:
1/4 cup palm shortening, softened
1/4 cup pumpkin purée 
3/4 cup coconut sugar
1/4 cup pure maple syrup 
3 eggs
1 teaspoon grain-free baking powder 
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 
3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice
1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt 
2 1/2 cups cashew flour 
1 1/2 cups arrowroot powder
1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons coconut flour

 

Glaze

1 egg white
1/2 cup arrowroot powder
1/2 cup maple sugar 
1/2 ounce cacao butter, melted
INSTRUCTIONS:
Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the beater attachment, or using an electric handheld mixer, cream together the palm shortening, pumpkin purée, coconut sugar, and maple syrup on medium speed for 1 minute. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating after each addition, until fully incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the baking powder, lemon juice, pumpkin pie spice, and salt to the bowl and mix to combine. Add the cashew flour, arrowroot, and coconut flour and mix on medium speed to incorporate. Let the dough rest for 15 minutes, then beat again for 30 seconds.
Divide the dough in half, form each half into a 4 by 11-inch loaf that’s 1 1/2 inches thick, and place on the prepared baking sheet.
Bake for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven, leaving the heat on. Allow the loaves to cool for 10 minutes. Then, with a sharp knife, cut the loaves diagonally into 1-inch-thick slices. Place the slices flat on the baking sheet and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 250°F. Bake for 25 minutes longer, flipping the cookies once halfway through, until crisp and golden.
Remove from the oven and cool completely on a wire rack.
As the cookies are cooling, make your glaze. Combine the glaze ingredients in a small bowl and whisk until smooth. Dip the cooled cookies into the glaze and then place them back on the wire rack for the glaze to harden.

Maple Frosted Pumpkin Spice Biscotti


AUTHOR: Danielle Walker - AgainstAllGrain.com
INGREDIENTS:
1/4 cup palm shortening, softened
1/4 cup pumpkin purée 
3/4 cup coconut sugar
1/4 cup pure maple syrup 
3 eggs
1 teaspoon grain-free baking powder 
1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice 
3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice

1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons coconut flour

 

Glaze

1 egg white
