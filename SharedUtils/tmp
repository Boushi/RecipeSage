Cover, turn the heat to low and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes, until the mixture is soft and aromatic. Stir in the fresh and dried mushrooms, turn the heat back up to medium, and cook, stirring, until the mushrooms are just tender, about 5 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in the wine and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring, for a few minutes, until the wine has reduced by about half. Add the tomatoes and salt and pepper to taste. Cook over medium heat for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring often, until the tomatoes have cooked down a little and smell fragrant. Stir in the mushroom soaking liquid that you set aside.\nReturn the chicken pieces to the pan and stir so that they are well submerged in the tomato mixture. Cover and simmer over medium heat for 30 minutes, until the chicken is tender. Taste, adjust seasoning and serve with pasta or rice.","image":{"key":"1568415313103","size":8921,"encoding":"7bit","location":"https://chefbook-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1568415313103","mimetype":"image/jpeg","fieldname":"image","originalname":"chickencaccitora-articleLarge.jpg"},"folder":"main","indexedAt":"2019-09-13T22:55:13.608Z","createdAt":"2019-09-13T22:55:13.608Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-13T23:46:57.402Z","userId":"f5e80279-5dd5-48d5-b4de-96c06acbcbfa","fromUserId":null,"labels":[],"isOwner":false},{"id":"bd1cccb8-5ffe-4480-99dd-353d56967971","title":"Chicken Relleno Soup","description":"","yield":"","activeTime":"","totalTime":"","source":"RealFoodWithJessica ","url":"https://www.realfoodwithjessica.com/2019/03/25/paleo-whole30-chicken-chili-relleno-soup/","notes":"col 9/2019","ingredients":"[POTATO MIXTURE]\n1.5 pounds yukon gold potatoes (about 7), chopped ... try 1.5lb cauliflower\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nwater to cover\n1.5-2 cups almond milk\n[SOUP]\n5 Poblano peppers\n1/2 cup chopped green onion\n2 tablespoons garlic oil\n1 teaspoon salt\n4 cups broth or water*\n1.5 pounds boneless skinless chicken\n1 teaspoon oregano","instructions":"Roast the peppers.

Season with salt and whisk again to combine.\n[Fritters]\nRinse lentils, then soak in 2 cups water at room temperature at least 1 hour and up to 12. Soaking the lentils for this long will make them super-plump and tender, which in turn makes them a lot easier to blend.\nMeanwhile, trim ends of zucchini and cut crosswise into 3 pieces about 2\" long. Cut each piece lengthwise into ¼\"-thick planks. Stack a few planks and slice lengthwise into ¼\"-thick matchsticks (about the size of a skinny french fry). Transfer zucchini to a colander set in a medium bowl. Add onion and 1 tsp. salt to colander and toss to combine. Let zucchini and onion sit until about 1 Tbsp. liquid has released and the vegetables look wilted and soft, 30 minutes–2 hours (to maximize your downtime, do this while the lentils are soaking). Gently pat dry with paper towels to remove any excess moisture. The less moisture in the veggies, the less soggy your fritters will be, so be sure not to skip this step.\nDrain lentils and transfer to a food processor. Add chile powder, turmeric, and ¾ tsp. salt. Pulse, scraping down sides, until a coarse purée forms. Transfer to a medium bowl and add zucchini and onion mixture, parsley, and lemon zest. Toss well with a rubber spatula to combine (it will look like too much vegetables for the lentils, but that’s just what you want).\nHeat ghee in a 10\" cast-iron skillet over medium-high until a small amount of batter added to the fat excitedly sizzles and sputters. Working in batches, carefully drop ¼ cup batter into ghee, then flatten to a pancake with the back of a large metal spoon dipped into the hot ghee to prevent sticking. Fry fritter until deep golden brown on one side (look for the color of a well-fried falafel), about 3 minutes. Turn with a slotted spatula or large spoon and fry until deep golden brown on the second side, about 3 minutes more. Transfer fritter to a wire rack set in a paper towel-lined baking sheet to drain. Season immediately with salt. Repeat with remaining batter (you should have 8–10 fritters).\nTransfer fritters to a platter. Serve hot with lemony yogurt alongside.","image":{"acl":"public-read","key":"1568383193296","etag":"\"f0581f2dcafcf527eec9b46ba151d3b3\"","size":9307,"bucket":"chefbook-prod","location":"https://chefbook-prod.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1568383193296","metadata":{"fieldName":"image"},"mimetype":"image/jpeg","fieldname":"image","originalname":"recipe-sage-img.jpg"},"folder":"main","indexedAt":"2019-09-13T13:59:53.760Z","createdAt":"2019-09-13T13:59:53.760Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-13T23:45:55.191Z","userId":"f5e80279-5dd5-48d5-b4de-96c06acbcbfa","fromUserId":null,"labels":[],"isOwner":false},{"id":"fda23da5-ee30-4b58-a6e4-2ece65689359","title":"Glazed Pumpkin Almond Butter Bars","description":"","yield":"9 serv","activeTime":"","totalTime":"40 mins","source":"Megan Gilmore, Detoxinista","url":"https://detoxinista.com/grain-free-pumpkin-bars/","notes":"col 9/2019\n\"If you'd prefer to use individual spices, I'd recommend using 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg and 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves to replace the 2 teaspoons of pumpkin pie spice.\"","ingredients":"1/2 cup pumpkin puree\n1/2 cup almond butter\n1/3 cup honey\n2 eggs\n2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice*\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1/4 teaspoon sea salt\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n[glaze]\n3/4 cup pecans\n1/4 cup pure maple syrup ... try honey\n2 Tablespoons coconut oil\n1/4 cup water\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\nPinch of sea salt","instructions":"Preheat oven to 350F and grease an 8\" x 8\" pan generously with coconut oil or butter.\nCombine all of the ingredients in a medium bowl, and mix well until a smooth batter forms.\nTransfer the batter to the greased pan, and bake at 350F for about 30 minutes, until the edges are golden brown and the center is firm.\nAllow to cool completely in the pan, then cut and serve!\nThese bars are delicious on their own, but if you're aiming to impress, glaze these bars with Maple Pecan Glaze.\n[glaze]\nCombine all of the ingredients in a high-speed blender, and blend until smooth and creamy.","image":{"acl":"public-read","key":"1567344715661","etag":"\"8506b4352f4ab68600c69a667c957af8\"","size":6100,"bucket":"chefbook-prod","location":"https://chefbook-prod.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1567344715661","metadata":{"fieldName":"image"},"mimetype":"image/jpeg","fieldname":"image","originalname":"recipe-sage-img.jpg"},"folder":"main","indexedAt":"2019-09-01T13:31:55.991Z","createdAt":"2019-09-01T13:31:55.992Z","updatedAt":"2019-09-01T13:34:16.927Z","userId":"f5e80279-5dd5-48d5-b4de-96c06acbcbfa","fromUserId":null,"labels":[],"isOwner":false},{"id":"a4a11d7f-aa42-40ba-acb2-64bd84ed5338","title":"Whiskey BBQ ketchup","description":"","yield":"approx 1 3/4  c","activeTime":"","totalTime":"25 minutes","source":"Minimalist Baker","url":"https://minimalistbaker.com/whiskey-bbq-ketchup/","notes":"col 9/2019","ingredients":"15 ounces tomato sauce\n1 6-ounce can tomato paste\n2-3 Tbsp whiskey (legal)\n2-3 Tbsp apple cider vinegar\n1/4 cup brown sugar ... use honey\n1/2 Tbsp Worcestershire\n1 tsp liquid smoke (unclear if legal)\n1/4 tsp each sea salt\n1/4 t ground black pepper\n1 tsp onion powder\n1 tsp garlic powder","instructions":"Add all ingredients to a small saucepan over medium heat and whisk to combine.\nCook until bubbly - about 5 minutes.

Flatten with you hands in the middle until it’s a flat pancake. Then cover with another piece of parchment paper of the same size and use a rolling pin to flatten the pancake into a thin dough layer, about 3-5mm. Roll it evenly in four directions starting from the middle. Finally using a knife make small incision marks vertically and horizontally to make it easier to break the crackers when cooked.\nPlace in the oven, middle shelf, and cook for about 15 minutes. The outer edges will cook faster so I recommend taking the tray out of the oven when those start going golden brown and slicing those edges off first, then putting the tray back in the oven for a further 3-5 minutes. Alternatively, before you put the tray in the oven in the first place, slice the thin pancake into halves and spread them apart so there is some space between the halves. When you’re taking them out, you will notice that there is some oil bubbling away around the cracker and that’s fine. Set the cooked cracker layer to cool before breaking apart.

Remove the large core and dice it into small (1/4 to 1/2-inch) pieces.

Scoop it out and set it aside before beginning the recipe as written. Once you add the cauliflower to the tomato sauce later in the recipe, you might need 5 minutes less cooking time to get it to a good consistency (I aim for tender but not mushy here).\nThen, in a large, deep sauté pan, heat oil over medium heat. Once hot, add cumin seeds, ginger, garlic, and jalapeño and cook together for 3 minutes, until tender but the garlic and ginger are not browned. \nAdd diced cauliflower core and finely chopped cilantro stems (save leaves for the end) and cook for another 1 minute together. \nAdd turmeric, chili powder, coriander, and garam masala and cook for 2 minutes. \nAdd 2 to 3 cups tomato puree — use the smaller amount if your cauliflower clocks in in the 2 to 2.5-pound range, or if you’re not sure you want dish as saucy as mine is, plus salt (1 1/2 teaspoons was just right for my 3 cups puree), and water and bring to a simmer, cook for 5 minutes. \nAdd cauliflower and stir to coat with sauce. Cover with a lid and cook for about 20 minutes, until cauliflower is tender but not mushy, stirring occasionally. \nAdd peas (still frozen are fine) and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until heated through. \nAdd amchur powder or lemon juice and stir to warm through. \nTaste dish for seasoning and adjust to taste.

Cover and simmer for 30 minutes without stirring, then add the mushrooms and cherry tomatoes; simmer for another 30 minutes.\nGently stir the pot to lightly coat the the vegetables, then distribute into bowls and serve.\n** Instant Pot (electric pressure cooker instructions): follow Steps 1 & 2 using the “Saute” setting on the pressure cooker, then pressure-cook the oxtails using the “Meat” setting for 40 minutes. Allow to depressurize naturally, then follow Steps 3 & 4 using the “Slow Cooker” (high) setting to finish.","image":{"key":"1537581961547","size":18726,"encoding":"7bit","location":"https://chefbook-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1537581961547","mimetype":"image/jpeg","fieldname":"image","originalname":"img_9790.jpg"},"folder":"main","indexedAt":"2019-03-19T16:04:00.586Z","createdAt":"2018-09-22T02:06:01.901Z","updatedAt":"2018-12-15T16:44:23.027Z","userId":"f5e80279-5dd5-48d5-b4de-96c06acbcbfa","fromUserId":null,"labels":[],"isOwner":false},{"id":"cc220388-f1fc-4fb8-92db-eb795b69dfe5","title":"Pad Priew Wan Goong (Thai Sweet and Sour Stir-Fry with Shrimp)","description":"Thai version is \"more on the sour side than sweet\"","yield":"4","activeTime":"","totalTime":"15 min?","source":"Domestic Man","url":"https://thedomesticman.com/2015/08/18/pad-priew-wan-goong-thai-sweet-and-sour-stir-fry-with-shrimp/#more-10747","notes":"col 9/2018","ingredients":"[sauce]\n1 tbsp fish sauce\n1 tbsp water\n1 tbsp lime juice (juice of 1/2 lime)\n1 tbsp tomato paste\n1 tbsp coconut palm sugar (honey okay. or apple juice.)\n1 tsp Tabasco garlic pepper sauce\n1 tsp tamari (or 1.5 tsp coconut aminos)\n1 tsp apple cider vinegar\n1 tsp salt\n1/2 tsp white pepper\n[dish]\n3 tbsp coconut oil, divided\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n1 lb shrimp\n1/2 onion, cut into bite-sized chunks (about 1/2 cup)\n1/2 pineapple, cut into bite-sized chunks (about 1 cup)\n1 tomato, cut into bite-sized chunks (about 1 cup)\n1 green bell pepper, cut into bite-sized chunks (about 1 cup)\n1 cucumber, cut into bite-sized chunks (about 1 cup)\nsalt and white pepper to taste\ncilantro leaves to garnish\nlime wedges to garnish","instructions":"Combine the sauce ingredients, stir together, then set aside.\nstage all ingredients. \nPat the shrimp dry with paper towels.\nHeat a wok over high heat until very hot (just smoking), about 1 minute.

Press down and smooth into an tightly-packed, even layer.\r\nMake the chocolate layer: Use the double boiler method or the following. In a medium, microwave-safe bowl, add Chocolate Layer ingredients (1/2 cup chocolate chips and ¼ cup + 1 tablespoon almond butter). Heat in 20-second increments until softened and melted. Stir until smooth.\r\nPour this chocolate mixture over the pecan bars. Using a rubber spatula, smooth into an even layer. Sprinkle ¼ cup chopped pecans evenly over the bars. Press pecans gently into the chocolate layer.\r\nFreeze for 20-30 minutes. Remove from freezer and slice into 16 bars. Enjoy!

You should be able to turn the bowl upside down. Set aside.\r\nBack to our chocolate mixture. Make sure it’s not too hot, it can be warm to touch but we don’t want to cook the eggs in it.

The mixture will now thicken slightly.\r\nAdd one third of the whipped egg whites to the chocolate mixture and stir through with a spatula until completely combined. Then add another third of the egg whites and fold those through, scraping the sides as you go along. Once the mixture is well combined, add the final third and fold it in as well, until there are no egg white clumps left. Don’t mix it too vigorously, nice and gentle is best for keeping the final cake mix airy and fluffy.\r\nPour the cake mix into the prepared tin, spread evenly and cut away excess paper that sticks over the top of the sides. Gently tap the cake tin on the surface tp flatten the top and break any trapped air bubbles in the cake. Place in the oven, middle shelf, for 30 mins.\r\nWhile the cake is baking, prepare the berries or other toppings of choice.\r\nAfter 30 minutes, turn the oven off and open the door. First, let the cake cool down slightly in the oven with an open door and then remove it from the oven and cool in the tin for 15-20 minutes longer. Only then remove from the tin.\r\nDecorate with berries and serve as is or with a side of whipped coconut cream or ice cream, or drizzled with melted chocolate sauce.","image":{"key":"1526259649071","size":9094,"encoding":"7bit","location":"https://chefbook-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/1526259649071","mimetype":"image/jpeg","fieldname":"image","originalname":"paleo-chocolate-cake-4.jpg"},"folder":"main","indexedAt":"2019-03-19T16:03:00.594Z","createdAt":"2018-05-14T01:00:49.285Z","updatedAt":"2018-12-15T16:44:22.962Z","userId":"f5e80279-5dd5-48d5-b4de-96c06acbcbfa","fromUserId":null,"labels":[],"isOwner":false},{"id":"b7e85607-9ccd-49c2-97c6-d967e6ac2e71","title":"Chocolate Mug Cake 2","description":"says it makes 2","yield":"","activeTime":"","totalTime":"6 min","source":"Vered DeLeeuw","url":"https://healthyrecipesblogs.com/2015/05/18/chocolate-mug-cake/","notes":"col 5/2018","ingredients":"1/4 cup creamy roasted almond butter (64 grams)\r\n1 large egg\r\n2 tablespoons whole milk or dairy free milk ... try coconut milk\r\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\r\n1/2 teaspoon stevia glycerite ... try 5t honey\r\nDash salt\r\n2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder\r\n1/4 teaspoon baking soda .... does it need any ACV I wonder?","instructions":"In a small bowl, whisk the almond butter and egg until smooth.\r\nAdd the milk, vanilla, stevia and salt, whisking to incorporate.\r\nGradually whisk in the cocoa powder, then add the baking soda.\r\nUsing a spatula, scrape the batter into two small, 6-ounce cappuccino mugs, dividing it evenly.

Stir in the ginger, allspice, fenugreek , oregano , turmeric, cardamom, garlic and onions and bring to a simmer . Simmer until the butter is clear and the milk solids remain on the bottom of the pan, about 30 minutes. Reduce the heat to low if the butter is boiling too quickly--if it burns it will taste bitter .\r\nFor the berbere (spice mix): Whisk together the chile powder, paprika, cayenne, ginger, salt, garlic powder, onion powder and nutmeg . Set aside.\r\nPut the cardamom , coriander, fenugreek, allspice, cloves and cinnamon in a small skillet and toast over medium-low heat, shaking the pan regularly, until fragrant, about 4 minutes. Cool slightly.\r\nGrind the toasted spices in a spice grinder to a fine powder. Add to the chile powder mixture and whisk to combine. Sift the spice mixture onto a piece of parchment paper, return to the bowl and whisk again. Return the pieces left in the sifter to the spice grinder and grind again as finely as possible; whisk into the spice mixture. Set aside.\r\nTo finish the niter kibbeh: Line a strainer with dampened cheesecloth . Skim the foam from the top of the butter and discard. Ladle the butter through the strainer, leaving behind the milk solids on the bottom of the pan.\r\nFor the chicken stew : Put the chicken in a nonreactive bowl and toss with the lemon juice and 1 teaspoon salt. Let stand at room temperature for 30 minutes.\r\nWhile the chicken is marinating, prepare a bowl with ice water. Bring a medium saucepan of water to a boil and salt generously, making sure there is enough water to cover the eggs by 1 inch. Carefully add the eggs, bring back to a gentle boil and cook for 6 minutes. Transfer the eggs to the ice water, and shake or tap gently to crack the shells. Remove the eggs from the water and, when cool to the touch, peel . Set aside; do not refrigerate or they will not warm up in the sauce.\r\nPut the onions in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until golden, about 10 minutes, taking care not to burn them. You may need to reduce the heat as the onions dry out.\r\nIncrease the heat to medium high; add 1/3 cup of the niter kibbeh , 1/4 cup of the berbere, the garlic, ginger, tomato paste and black pepper, and cook, stirring, for 1 minute. Add the chicken, turning to coat well with the butter mixture, and then leave the chicken skin-side down in the pan.\r\nAdd the chicken stock, bring to a simmer, cover, reduce the heat to low and cook at a gentle simmer until the chicken is very tender, about 40 minutes. Remove the lid, increase the heat to medium and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the liquid is reduced and the sauce is very thick, about 45 minutes, occasionally spooning the sauce over the chicken.\r\nRemove the pan with the chicken from the heat and add the eggs, turning to coat them in the sauce. Cover the pan and let rest for 5 minutes.\r\nTo serve, place the chicken thighs and eggs on injera or serving plates, and spoon the sauce over.\r\nNotes Cook's Notes: Starting the onions in a dry pan is traditional for this dish and adds a toasty taste. Just be careful not to let the onions burn. This recipe makes more than enough berbere and niter kibbeh to make the chicken. Refrigerate any leftovers to use in other Ethiopian recipes.","image":{"acl":"public-read","key":"1519429812200","etag":"\"048f3fa530b209ad7a492a723ef13f5c\"","size":"12460","bucket":"chefbook-prod","location":"https://chefbook-prod.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1519429812200","metadata":{"fieldName":"image"},"mimetype":"image/jpeg","fieldname":"image","originalname":"pepperplate-image.jpg"},"folder":"main","indexedAt":"2019-03-19T16:02:00.642Z","createdAt":"2018-02-23T23:50:15.019Z","updatedAt":"2018-12-15T16:44:22.802Z","userId":"f5e80279-5dd5-48d5-b4de-96c06acbcbfa","fromUserId":null,"labels":[],"isOwner":false},{"id":"230db219-e084-4a31-8f5a-284097f22d9b","title":"Ultimate Pizza Sauce","description":"","yield":"1-2 pizzas","activeTime":"","totalTime":"1 hour 20 minutes","source":"","url":"http://www.food.com/recipe/ultimate-pizza-sauce-114392","notes":"tried for Oven firing 2015","ingredients":"2 tablespoons olive oil\r\n1 tablespoon butter\r\n1/2 cup onion, chopped\r\n1/4 cup celery, chopped\r\n1 garlic clove, minced\r\n1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce\r\n1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste\r\n2 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese\r\n1 teaspoon dried basil\r\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\r\n1/2 teaspoon salt\r\n1/2 teaspoon sugar\r\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\r\n1 small bay leaf\r\n1 teaspoon fennel seed","instructions":"In a large skillet, melt butter with the oil.

Remove the mixture from pan and set aside. Wipe the pan if necessary.\r\nTo peel the tomatoes: In a medium saucepan, boil enough water to generously cover the tomatoes over high heat. Prepare a bowl with enough ice water to cover the tomatoes. Core the tomatoes and slit the skin at the bottom of each tomato in an X. Put the tomatoes in the boiling water and boil just until the skins start to pull away from the X, about 30 seconds. Transfer the tomatoes to the bowl of ice water. Remove the tomatoes from the cold water promptly and pull off the peel with the aid of a paring knife. Halve the tomatoes and squeeze out their juice and seeds, reserving the juice. Chop the tomatoes very fine; you should have about 1 cup. Strain the tomato juice.\r\nCut each tilapia fillet in half lengthwise along the center line.\r\nHeat 1 tablespoon olive oil in the sauté pan over medium-low heat. Add 1 1/2 teaspoons of the minced garlic and cook until it is fragrant, about 10 seconds. Add the tomatoes, saffron, turmeric, paprika, oregano and a pinch of salt and pepper.

Cover and cook over medium-low heat until the fish becomes opaque in its thickest part, about 4 minutes for thinner pieces or about 5 minutes for thicker ones; check with the point of a sharp knife. Using a fish spatula or slotted spatula, transfer each piece gently to a plate. Repeat with the remaining tilapia fillets. .\r\nAdd the onion-pepper mixture to the sauce and bring it to a simmer. Cover and cook over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally, until the peppers are tender, about 5 minutes. If the pan becomes dry during simmering, add 2 or 3 tablespoons water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Add the remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic, stir and remove from the heat.\r\nDrain any liquid from the plate of tilapia into the sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add 2 to 4 tablespoons of the reserved tomato juice. Add cayenne pepper if desired and 1 tablespoon olive oil. Stir in 2 tablespoons cilantro. Taste and adjust seasoning.\r\nPut the tilapia on a serving platter or on plates and top each piece with some of the pepper sauce. Sprinkle with the remaining cilantro.

Cover with fresh water and stir in the garlic cloves and a few pinches of salt and pepper. Bring to a boil then lower the heat and simmer for 60 minutes to 2 hours, or until just tender but not falling apart. You can also cook them in the pressure cooker for about 40 minutes (or according to your pressure cooker instructions). When cooked, spread on a large baking sheet to cool.\r\nRecipe Shortcut: You can also substitute 4 cans of canned chickpeas. Drain and rinse thoroughly before using. I do encourage you to use freshly cooked chickpeas; they are creamy and tender in a really different way than canned garbanzos.\r\nWhile the chickpeas are cooling, peel and quarter the onion. Shave it as thin as possible into a large bowl, using a very sharp knife or a mandoline. Stir in the sumac, chili powder, and salt. Use your hands to massage the spices and salt into the onions for several minutes. Drain off any liquid that develops in the bottom of the bowl.\r\nAdd the chickpeas and chopped parsley to the onions and use your hands or two forks to toss everything thoroughly. Whisk together the lemon juice, olive oil, and pomegranate syrup and toss with the salad. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Continue tossing until the onions are fully incorporated and no longer in small clumps. Refrigerate until serving (this salad gets better overnight).\r\nJust before serving, finely chop the mint leaves and sprinkle over the salad.","image":{"acl":"public-read","key":"1519429811934","etag":"\"50f5cf44db9c058263a2220e34e66859\"","size":"18253","bucket":"chefbook-prod","location":"https://chefbook-prod.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/1519429811934","metadata":{"fieldName":"image"},"mimetype":"image/jpeg","fieldname":"image","originalname":"pepperplate-image.jpg"},"folder":"main","indexedAt":"2019-03-19T16:02:00.642Z","createdAt":"2018-02-23T23:50:14.443Z","updatedAt":"2018-12-15T16:44:22.771Z","userId":"f5e80279-5dd5-48d5-b4de-96c06acbcbfa","fromUserId":null,"labels":[],"isOwner":false},{"id":"78b58b43-92af-4d00-b16c-572b0304959e","title":"Hamburger Stew","description":"Incl SCD version","yield":"","activeTime":"","totalTime":"","source":"VIB Hunts Tomato Paste Cookbook","url":"","notes":"col circa earl 1980s","ingredients":"1 lb hamburger\n1 T olive oil\n1 onion finely chopped\n2 to 3 carrots, chopped to 1/2\" pieces ... 3-5 for scd\n2 to 3 celery stalks, chopped to 1/2\" pieces ... 3-4 for scd\n1 parsnip, optional, chopped to 1/2\" pieces ...
