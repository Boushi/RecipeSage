  <p><b>A little about me</b></p>
  <p>I'm a software developer in Long Beach, California. I do a lot of work with nonprofits and I spend a lot of time working on small projects.</p>
  <p>RecipeSage is one of my hobbies - I work on it in my free time. At work, I develop educational software for universities.</p>
  <p>I have been working on RecipeSage since 2017 - It's exciting to see how it has grown and changed over time.</p>

  <br />
  <p><b>Why create RecipeSage?</b></p>
  <p>I created RecipeSage to host recipes for me and my family. After trying multiple recipe programs online, I felt it would be best to create a recipe program that worked exactly as I wanted it to.</p>
  <p>
    I'm a believer in freeware - I want RecipeSage to be free to use. Everyone should be able to access and use this software.
    Please, feel free to suggest new features and improvements. I want RecipeSage to grow and improve.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you'd like to <a (click)="$event.preventDefault(); goToDonate()" href="">contribute to support development</a>, I'd really appreciate it. It's costly to run servers and host images, and I'd love help!
    Contributing also unlocks some features for your account (features that are cost-prohibitive to offer for free) as a thank you.
