      <p>
        Welcome to the main page of RecipeSage! This is where most of the action happens.
        Here you can search, sort and filter for the recipes you're looking for.<br /><br />
        To create a recipe, you'll need to click that big blue button in the bottom right hand corner.
        That will take you to the recipe authoring page.<br /><br />
        To open a recipe from the my recipes page, click that recipe. This will take you to the recipe details page for that recipe.<br /><br />
        If you'd like to open a recipe in a new tab, you can hold the control key (Windows and Linux) or command key (Mac) as you click a recipe.<br /><br />
        Your recipe list should update automatically. To refresh your recipe list manually, pull down when at the top of the list.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h3>My Recipes Settings</h3>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/home-popover.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        You can use the settings icon in the upper right-hand corner to adjust sort order, filter by label, and enable/disable
        different visual items.<br /><br />

        Here is a brief description of what each of these settings do:<br /><br />

        <b>Show Labels</b>: When enabled, you'll see a list of labels below the title on each recipe. This setting is visual only.<br /><br />

        <b>Show Label Toggles</b>: When enabled, you'll see buttons for each of your labels at the top of your recipe list.
        You can then select them to filter your recipes by label.<br /><br />

        <b>Show Images</b>: When enabled, you'll see recipe images. This setting is visual only - useful if you're on a limited data connection.<br /><br />

        <b>Show Source</b>: When enabled, you'll see the recipe source below the recipe title on each recipe. This setting is visual only.<br /><br />

        <b>Sort By</b>: Selecting a different sort order will change the order in which recipes appear in the list. This setting is visual only.<br /><br />

        <b>Filter by Label</b>: Allows you to filter your recipes by assigned labels.<br /><br />

        <b>Match All Labels</b>: Changes how label filter is applied.
        Example: When off, filtering by labels "dinner" and "soup" will show recipes that have <i>either</i> of those labels.
        When on, filtering by labels "dinner" and "soup" will only show recipes that have <i>both</i> of those labels.
      </p>

      <h3>My Recipes Bulk Actions</h3>
      <div class="tutorial-image">

      </div>
      <p>
        You can select multiple recipes by using the "Select Multiple Recipes" option in the popover menu,
        then tapping the recipes you'd like to select.
        Then, use the buttons in the header to create a label for, or delete all of those recipes at the same time.<br /><br />
        You can tap a recipe again to deselect it, or press the X in the top left corner to cancel your selection altogether.

      </div>
      <p>
        This is the authoring and editing experience for RecipeSage.<br /><br />
        Fill in the corresponding fields as you wish - only the title is required. After you're done, don't forget to hit save!<br /><br />
        To add an image, click the image holder at the top. Your browser will prompt you to select a file.<br /><br />
        The best images are square - don't worry about size though, RecipeSage will optimize it automatically for thumbnail use.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Recipe Formatting</h2>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/recipe-details-ingredients.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Ingredients are divided by linebreaks, so have one per carriage return.
        Ingredient measurements will be automatically parsed, but as a general rule, try to format them as such: 1 1/2 cup.
        For a range, use: 1 to 2 cups.
        This will help the scaling feature recognize your quantities as best as possible<br /><br />
        Instructions are divided by linebreaks as well, so put each step on a different carriage return. Make sure not to have
        extra carriage returns in-between!<br /><br />
        To add a header to your instructions or ingredients, put an open and close bracket at the ends of the line like
        this:<br />
        [The dough:]<br />
        1/2 cup water<br />
        [The sauce:]<br />
        1/8 cup sugar

      <p>
        This page is the detailed view for a single recipe.
        All of the information for the selected recipe is printed here, as well as buttons for various actions.<br /><br />
        The page layout will change based on the screen size of the device you're browsing on so that it's always optimized.
        For the best experience, we suggest having a device large enough to where the ingredients and instructions are shown
        side-by-side.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Scaling a Recipe</h2>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/recipe-details-scale.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Click the scale link to choose a different recipe scale. A dialogue will pop up for the recipe scale.
        Enter a number or a fraction and the ingredient quantities (shown in bold) will adjust.<br /><br />
        Keep in mind that any measurements that are not shown in bold aren't recognized and won't be scaled.<br /><br />
        Values entered into the scale field are not permanent. Once you close this recipe, the scale will default back
        to the scale entered in the recipe editor.

      <h2>Creating and Deleting Labels</h2>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/recipe-details-actions.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        Labels are an excellent way of organizing your recipes.
        Think of labels as folders, but where a single recipe can be in multiple folders!<br /><br />
        To add a label to a recipe, enter the label name in the field below the labels header as shown above,
        and press enter to save.<br /><br />
        Suggestions will be shown below the field as you type - they will be filtered as you type your label name.
        You can click a suggestion to automatically add that label.
        To remove a label, just click the trash can icon.<br /><br />
        You can filter by labels on the my recipes page to see only recipes in a certain label.<br /><br />

    <div *ngIf="active == 'peopleProfile'" class="ion-padding">
      <br />
      <h2>People Page</h2>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/people-friend-requests.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        This page is the start page for all pages related to people &amp; your profile.<br />
        Once you set up your profile, this page will allow you to access your profile &amp; settings, add friends, and search for people.<br />
        You'll also be able to share individual recipes, all recipes within a label, or even your entire recipe library with friends or the public.<br /><br />
        Friend invites and friends will show up on this page as seen in the image above.<br />
        To access these features however, you'll need to first set up your profile<br />
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Setting Up Your Profile</h2>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/people-setup-profile.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        To setup your profile, you'll first need to enter a publicly visible name. This corresponds to the nickname you set on your account
        when you registered.<br />
        Please avoid entering profane or offensive names, and feel free to report offsensive or profane names that you see.<br /><br />
        Next, you'll need to enter a unique @handle. This is a unique word or phrase that will identify you on RecipeSage.<br />
        It has to be unique to you, so you'll see a warning when you enter a handle that someone else has already claimed.<br />
        This handle will be part of the URL for your profile, and others will be able to find you using this handle if you share it with them<br />
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Finding Other Users</h2>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/people-add-friend.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        After you setup your profile, you can find other users profiles by clicking the search button in the bottom right corner of the people page.<br />
        This will bring up the dialogue shown in the image above.<br /><br />
        This dialogue allows you to search for other users by handle or by email.<br />
        After selecting a user, you'll be able to send a friend request, or view the other person's profile.<br />
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Friend Requests</h2>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/people-friend-requests.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        After finding another user and sending a friend request using the previous step in this tutorial, you'll see that pending friend request listed on the people page.<br />
        At this point, the other user will see a friend request in their people page, and can decide to either accept/deny that invite.<br />
        Once they accept, you'll see that user listed under your "friends" section.<br /><br />
        At any point during the friending process, you can click the user's name to open their profile page.<br />
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Editing Your Profile</h2>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/people-edit-profile.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        On this page, you'll be able to edit the details of your profile including adding and removing profile items.<br /><br />
        To edit your profile name or handle, click the pencil icon next to your name or handle, type the new name or handle you'd like your profile to have,
        and click the save button at the bottom of the page.<br /><br />
        The "enable profile" toggle allows you to control whether the people feature is enabled within RecipeSage.<br />
        If you disable your profile, you have effectively turned off all people related features. Other users won't be able to see your profile at all, including friends.<br /><br />
        Adding items to your profile allows you to share individual recipes, all recipes within a label, or your entire collection with friends or the public.<br />
        Click the "add" button to open the dialogue for adding a new profile item.<br /><br />
        Note: Nothing on your profile will actually change until you press the save button at the bottom of the page. You're free to edit as much as you'd like before saving.<br />
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Adding Profile Items</h2>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/people-add-profile-item.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        The profile item dialogue will allow you to add recipes, labels, or your entire library to your profile for others to see and access.<br />
        This dialogue will guide you through the process of adding an item depending on what type you select.<br /><br />
        If you select the "recipe" or "label" type, you'll be asked to search for and select the item that you'd like to share.<br />
        Next, the dialogue will ask you whether you want to share this item (or set of items) with the public, or only with your friends.<br /><br />
        Keep in mind, if you share with the public, that means anyone will be able to view this item if they have your RecipeSage @handle.<br />
        As always, only you can modify your recipes.<br />
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Viewing Profiles</h2>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/people-view-profile.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        This is what a user's profile page looks like.<br />
        You can use their profile page to access their shared recipes.<br /><br />
        Keep in mind that a user's profile may appear differently, depending on whether you're friends with that user or not.<br />
        If you're friends with the user, you'll not only see public items, but friends-only items as well.<br /><br />
        Simply click one of the listed items on their profile (if they have any) to open it.<br />
        To save a recipe from someone elses profile to your collection, open the recipe that you'd like to save and click the blue button at the bottom of the recipe details page.<br />

      <h2>Clip Tool Browser Extension Installation</h2>

      <p>
        Adding the RecipeSage browser extension allows you to quickly select text from a webpage and save recipes directly to your
        account via the handy clip tool. You can trigger the clip tool on most websites to grab text and import recipes
        into your collection.<br /><br />
        To install the RecipeSage browser extension, you'll need to be using a browser that supports WebExtensions.<br />
        At the time of writing, this includes Firefox and Google Chrome.<br /><br />
        If you're using Google Chrome, <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/oepplnnfceidfaaacjpdpobnjkcpgcpo" target="_blank">click here</a><br />
        If you're using Firefox, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/recipesage/" target="_blank">click here</a>
      </p>

      <h2>Signing In and Getting Started</h2>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/webextension-login.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        After installing the extension, you'll notice a new icon next to your navbar as pictured above.
        The first time you click that icon, you'll be prompted to sign in to your RecipeSage account with your RecipeSage credentials.<br />
        You'll then be shown a short tutorial, and the clip tool will open on the current page.
        After this, clicking the RecipeSage icon will launch the clip tool immediately.<br /><br />

        Note: If you don't have a RecipeSage account, you'll need to create one (see "Register" in the sidebar).<br />
        Note: The clip tool cannot be activated on certain websites, such as browser settings pages and websites with certain security policies.
      </p>

      <br />
      <h2>Using the Clip Tool</h2>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/webextension-body.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        This is the clip tool. It allows you to quickly select text from a webpage and save recipes directly to your account.<br /><br />
        To use it, highlight some text on the page using your mouse cursor, then press the button next to the desired field.<br />
        The text you've selected will be copied into that field, where you can edit or refine the text.<br /><br />

        To snip an image from the page, the process is slightly different - right click an image on the page,
        and select the "Snip Image" option. The image source URL will be copied to the image URL field.<br /><br />

        After you're done filling in the desired fields, press the "Save" button.
        A popup notification will let you know if the recipe saved successfully or not.
        If the recipe saved successfully, you'll receive a popup with a link to open the recipe in the full view.<br /><br />

        Note: Only the title field is required.<br />
        Note: Not all images will be snippable. If you're having trouble with an image, try creating your recipe first, then
        edit the recipe on RecipeSage.com and add the image afterwards.<br />
        Note: The clip tool is draggable. Click and hold on the icon in the upper left corner to move it anywhere within
        the page.
      </p>

      <h2>Auto Field Detection (AutoClipping)</h2>
      <div class="tutorial-image">
        <img src="assets/tutorial/webextension-body-autoclipped.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        This is what the clip tool looks like when automatic field detection is enabled. To enable automatic field detection,
        check the box at the top of the click tool and reload the page. Then re-open the clip tool.<br /><br />

        When auto field detection is enabled, the clip tool will do it's best to find recognized fields within the page content.
        When it detects corresponding content, it will automatically fill in the associated field.<br /><br />

        This isn't perfect, unfortunately. Since every website is different, there is no "standard" way to recognize recipe content.
        The clip tool does it's best to find common fields and naming conventions, but will sometimes get it wrong.<br /><br />

        If the clip tool gets a field wrong, you can always select a different block of text on the page and hit the snip button next to
        that field. The field will then be overwritten with your selection.

      <h2>General FAQ</h2>
      <br />
      <p>
        <b>Q: My search results include results that don't match the search</b><br />
        The RecipeSage search tool returns results that are as "close" to your match as possible, but also includes misspellings and similar words.<br />
        Searches will return matches with the exact search text further up in the results list.<br />

        <b>Q: Is RecipeSage compatible with IOS and Android?</b><br />
        Yep! You can use RecipeSage in the browser on your mobile device, or install it to your device.<br />
        See our install instructions here: <a href="/#/install">Download & Install</a>.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Q: Is RecipeSage a business?</b><br />
        No - it's an open source project that I develop in my free time. You can read more about what I do at work on the <a href="/#/about/details">about page</a>.<br />
        My wife also helps with some of the social media outreach and tutorials. She's awesome!<br />
        All contributions go into hosting costs, as well as making RecipeSage a better platform.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Q: What happens if you decide to just "stop hosting RecipeSage"? I'm worried about my data.</b><br />
        Although I have no plans to stop hosting RecipeSage, this is an understandable fear with any web-based platform.<br />
        First, you can always export your data at any time in a number of different formats.<br />
        Second, you can always transition to your own self-hosted instance if you're technically savvy (see the selfhost question below)<br />
        Third, RecipeSage is open source which means that in reality RecipeSage won't "stop existing", even if I were to get hit by a bus.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Q: Can I selfhost my own instance of RecipeSage?</b><br />
        Yes, for personal, private, non-commercial use only. You can find all of the resources to do that here:<br />

      <p>
